# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Interpreting user needs can come from responses given from a user. These responses can be guided by an outline created by me to limit interpretation and hit main objectives. User stories can help with this since they are more focused chunks of the larger project. In these user stories, definition of done statements can be set to ensure that these specific user stories are only completed when the set criteria is hit.
# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
