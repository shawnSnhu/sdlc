# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Interpreting user needs can come from responses given from a user. These responses can be guided by an outline created by me to limit interpretation and hit main objectives. User stories can help with this since they are more focused chunks of the larger project. In these user stories, definition of done statements can be set to ensure that these specific user stories are only completed when the set criteria is hit.
# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach developing programs by first trying to understand the big picture. I may not have all the pieces understood or the technical knowledge to create the program, but I can start to gain a better understanding and know where to start researching once I know the overall scope of a desired program. I think setting goals by size and scope can help when working on a development piece. This can then set the order of priority so that no overlap or wasted time is incurred.
# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member is able to communicate effectively. This means that they know when to reach out for assistance when necessary, but they also know where to go for that assistance. Being able to explain ideas and issues with others is also key, since not everyone will be at the same level. If a team member cannot communicate what they have been creating to a basic user, does that team member fully understand what they have been creating?
